# calunder
like python calendar, but kinda better

## why?
python calendar was boring so I made it better

you should read calendar.py and see how boring it was (yes, really... do it now)

also run this so you can see the boringness

```
python -m calendar 2016
```

## wut?
i almost made it better 

you should try this now

```
python -m calunder 2016
```

but it would be *WAY* cooler if it didn't have these bugs

- johnuary - not a month i guess
- wish weeks didn't start on thursday
- lines are spaced too far apart
- wasn't 2016 a leap year?
- months have pretty names, but `Mon Jan  1 00:00:00 2001` isn't one of them
